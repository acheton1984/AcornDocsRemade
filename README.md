# AcornDocsRemade

This repository contains reconstructed versions of internal Acorn technical documents, based on scans and files originally made public via the Stardot forums.

These are not facsimiles but remakes: faithful in style to the originals, rebuilt as searchable PDFs with minor corrections for archival and reference use.

Each PDF includes a short preface outlining its source and any changes made during reconstruction.

These remakes were first published at:
